# lambda calculus parser

Authors: Nick Budimirovich & Kyle DeLancey

Goals:
1. Create a parser which takes a string in simply typed lambda calc syntax (Will use a special character to represent lambdas, likely &) and parses it.
2. Develop a type checker which, given the parsed  expression, determines if the typing is incorrect in any way.
